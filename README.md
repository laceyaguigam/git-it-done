# Git It Done

## Purpose
Open source projects are a great way to continue building your coding skills and adding more projects to your portfolio. Open source projects are not always easy to find so why not fix that by creating our own web app. The following project is a web application that can be used to find open source projects on Github by searching usernames. 
## Installation

Clone the source code for Get It Done from the Get It Done repository and save to desired location. The source code can then be used in your desired coding software.
## Usage

Open the Get It Done folder in vs code or with any coding software and open the index.html file in desired browser. Once the index.html file is opened, the user be able to search any Github username. Once the username is searched all of the corresponding repositories for that username will appear on the right side of the page. When the user clicks on a respository it will take the user to a separate page and list all of the open issues for that repository.
